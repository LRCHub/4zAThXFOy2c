She left me right outside el paso
Leavin scottsdale from a show
She said our lives are just to crazy
With us both out on the road.

Im wonderin what shes doin now
With her friends out on the town
Is she wonderin how im makin out
With every drink i wash her down
Tennessee whiskey tell me did ya miss me
She broke my heart when she left me
And now i need you to protect me

Sweet tennessee whiskeyyy ya ya ya
Sweet tennessee whiskeyyyy ya yeahh

Somethin somethin somethin
Feelin lonely in this crazy crowd
Forget the memories, try and make my peace and get up off the ground

Heyy yeahhh yeahhhh
Sweet tennessee whiskey, tell me did ya miss me
She broke my heart when she left me
And now i need you to protect me

Sweet tenneessee whiskeyyyy
Tell me did ya miss me
She broke my heart when she left me
And now i need you to protect meeee

Sweet tennessee whiskeyyy ya ya yeahhh
Sweet tenessee whiskeyyy ya ya yeahhh

Cuz ill see her when i get home.

Sweet tennessee whiskeyyyy
Sweet tennessee whiskeyyyy

By the time we got to austin
I was damn near insane
I hadnt heard from her in three days
I kept waitin on that phone to ring

Im wonderin what shes doin now
With her friends out on the town
If shes wonderin how im makin out
With every drink i wask her down
Tennessee whiskey tell me did ya miss me
She broke my heart when she left me
Now i need you to protect me
