[00:01.58] I used to spend my nights out in a barroom
[00:09.99] Liquor was the only love I've known
[00:19.36] But you rescued me from reaching for the bottle
[00:28.14] And you brought me back from being too far gone
[00:51.64] 
[00:36.54] You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
[00:44.74] You're as sweet as strawberry wine
[00:54.54] You're as warm as a glass of brandy
[01:03.98] And I stay stoned on your love all the time
[01:25.48] 
[01:23.04] I look for love in all the same old places
[01:32.01] Found the bottom of the bottle always dry
[01:40.87] But when you poured out your heart, I didn't waste it
[01:48.92] 'Cause there nothing like your love to gettin' me high
[02:15.92] 
[01:58.72] You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey
[02:07.24] You're as sweet as strawberry wine
[02:16.36] You're as warm as a glass of brandy
[02:25.98] And I stay stoned on your love all the time
[02:35.49] I stay stoned on your love all the time
