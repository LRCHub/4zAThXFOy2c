[00:25.08] Used to spend my nights out in a bar room
[00:32.73] Liquor was the only love I've known
[00:41.28] But you rescued me from reachin' for the bottom
[00:48.05] And brought me back from being too far gone
[01:09.55] 
[00:56.03] You're as smooth
[01:02.27] As Tennessee whiskey
[01:07.08] You're as sweet
[01:11.25] As strawberry wine
[01:17.06] You're as warm
[01:20.86] As a glass of brandy
[01:26.05] And honey, I stay stoned on your love
[01:30.36] All the time
[01:36.36] 
[01:35.82] I've looked for love in all the same old places
[01:44.09] Found the bottom of the bottles always dry
[01:53.63] But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it
[02:00.45] 'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high
[02:26.45] 
[02:10.44] You're as smooth
[02:19.08] As Tennessee whiskey
[02:23.13] You're as sweet
[02:27.22] As strawberry wine
[02:31.64] You're as warm
[02:36.61] As a glass of brandy
[02:41.58] And honey, I stay stoned on your love
[02:45.37] All the time
[02:51.37] 
[02:51.12] You're as smooth
[03:32.13] As Tennessee whiskey
[03:36.82] You're as sweet
[03:42.61] As strawberry wine
[03:49.09] You're as warm
[03:52.51] As a glass of brandy
[03:58.43] Honey, I stay stoned on your love
[03:59.57] All the time
[04:07.65] You're as smooth
[04:12.12] As Tennessee whiskey
[04:17.02] Tennessee Whiskey
[04:21.08] Tennessee Whiskey
[04:26.59] You're as smooth
[04:31.00] As Tennessee Whiskey
[04:36.63] Tennessee whiskey
[04:41.07] Tennessee whiskey
